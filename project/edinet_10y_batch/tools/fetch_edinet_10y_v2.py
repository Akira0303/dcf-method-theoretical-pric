[INFO] fetch_edinet_10y_v2.py (compat stub)
This project now expects pre-downloaded EDINET S*.zip files.
Put them under:
  /mnt/storage/project/edinet_10y_batch/work/zip

Then run:
  bash tools/bulk_ixds_to_facts.sh /mnt/storage/project/edinet_10y_batch/work/zip \\
                                   /mnt/storage/project/edinet_10y_batch/work/oim_out

(If you really need automated fetching again, tell me and Iâ€™ll provide a dedicated fetcher.)
